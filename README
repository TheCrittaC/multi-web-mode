1. Introduction

   Multi Web Mode is a minor mode wich makes web editing in Emacs much
   easier.

   Basically what it does is select the appropiate major mode
   automatically when you move the point and also calculates the
   correct indentation of chunks according to the indentation of the
   most relevant major mode.

2. Requirements

   You don't need any special libraries to run this package since it
   includes already all the necessary major-modes and extras.

   Regarding the version of Emacs, this package was tested successfully
   with 22.1 and 23.0.60.

3. Installation

   To install Multi Web Mode just put
   (load "<path-to-multiweb-mode>/load.el") in your .emacs file and
   you are done.

   Restart Emacs or use M-x load-file ~/.emacs.

4. Usage

   Multi Web Mode binds the following keystrokes:

   [12] : Sets the major mode to the correct one according to the
   chunk where the point is located.

   [tab] : Is bound to `mweb-indent'.

   [backtab] : Deletes indentation, useful when magic indentation
   `mweb-submodes-magic-indent' is nil. It deletes the number of spaces
   defined in `mweb-default-submode-indent-offset'.

   [M-TAB] : Calls nxml-complete.
